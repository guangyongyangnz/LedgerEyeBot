# LedgerEyeBot

## Objective
Monitor purchase records of smart wallets across different blockchains and compile token statistics. If a smart walletâ€™s purchase amount for a specific token exceeds a set threshold within a given time frame, an alert will be automatically sent to a Telegram bot as a strong buy signal.

## Phases

### Phase 1
Monitor purchase records of smart wallets on the Solana blockchain.

### Phase 2
Aggregate purchase records by token within a specific time frame and send alert messages.

### Phase 3
Extend monitoring to the Ethereum blockchain.
